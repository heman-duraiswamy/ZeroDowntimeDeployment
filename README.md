# Zero Downtime Deployment using Hadoop
If you are running an internet based business, every second lost for planned maintenance or for un-planned downtime, is a loss of revenue. Here we talk about how to achieve Zero downtime app deployment using Hadoop! We will discuss at length how to combine the streaming log data with the historic transactional data to build a killer framework that will deliver stable continuous delivery pipeline, reliable canary app deployment process, un-matched A/B testing framework, and above all real-time app monitoring that automatically scales the cluster / deliver disaster recovery mechanism at a server level. Such Zero downtime framework provides you with a flexibility to innovate, deploy, learn, fine-tune; innovate, deploy, learn, fine-tune, many times over... The whole underlying theme is: Move fast, fail small; but never ever have a down time!
